Research has long acknowledged that culture has an impact on the adoption and use of information technology. Cultural differences can cause conflicts, especially when learners provide each other with feedback during the peer assessment process. With this paper, we use a design science approach to create a cultural sensitive peer assessment process in MOOCs. Based on Hofstede's cultural dimension theory we derive design elements and evaluate them in a qualitative and comparative study with Swiss and Chinese students. Our results show that different cultures prefer different designs. Consequently, our key contribution is the practical elaboration of design elements, which can be integrated in MOOCs to provide a better learning experience. Further, we contribute to cross-cultural theory by using an existing framework and adapting it to a new and relevant phenomenon: MOOCs.},

This is reflected by a growing number of digital feedback apps which facilitate high-frequency feedback exchange. However, the effect of feedback has hardly been studied on an organizational level due to complexity. Therefore, we strive to analyze organizational feedback exchange with an agent-based simulation model. Concretely, we study the effect of feedback length and feedback frequency on the organizational return on investment (ROI) of feedback exchange. Our study shows that feedback length stays in an inverted U-shape relationship with ROI. Contrarily, feedback frequency is negatively correlated with ROI. When analyzed jointly, two sweet spots arise: one for medium-length, frequent feedback, and the other, for longer infrequent feedback.},

In conversation, coaches can intervene to promote learning goal attainment by using behavioural change techniques (BCTs). In a coaching chatbot, such techniques can be ordered in an established, structured way to good effect. With recent technological advances, chatbot responses can be generated adaptively; this means that BCTs can be applied in an adaptive but less structured way. It is yet unclear whether this latter form of configuring coaching interventions is viable, how they compare to more established structured interventions, and whether both methods can be combined. For the purpose of answering this, we propose a 2x2 experimental design with the two intervention types as factors and goal attainment as the dependent variable. Results will indicate avenues for automating skilled conversation including choice of technology.},

Agents often employ tools beyond language generation, such as calculators or search, to further augment these capabilities. We focus on how such tools can give the agent too much external context, diverting it from the user's original intent. According to Conversation Analysis, human-human dialogue often uses "insert-expansion" - inserted utterances for clarification - to resolve ambiguities. Building on this, we introduce a "user-as-a-tool" approach, enabling the AI agent to solicit clarification from the user while still reasoning, thereby realigning it with the user's intent. Initial evidence shows that our approach has benefits for conversational recommendation systems. We present a novel interaction method and empirical findings that enhance the user's role in guiding agent reasoning. This research is especially relevant as AI agents become increasingly common, and holds significance for optimizing the human-chatbot interaction loop.},

Recent innovations have uncovered that multiple chained calls tend to produce better results. Even more impactful is the discovery that these chains do not need to be predefined. LLM-based AI agents use frameworks to generate written intermediate reasoning that decides which steps to take next and when to return with a final output. LLM-based AI agents can use external tools like search engines, calculators, code engines, etc. to gather information and act on the world. Developments in this area are rapid and potentially consequential. However, it is difficult to keep apace with the developments.

Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a crucial 21st-century skill, enabling individuals to solve problems more effectively through an automation-oriented perspective and fundamental concepts of computer science. To ensure the effective integration of CT into educational curricula, it is crucial to develop efficient assessment frameworks that allow teachers to measure and promote student CT proficiency. Therefore, our aim is to develop a short test to measure CT among undergraduate students. To this end, we consider two performance tests: the Computational Thinking test (CTt) and the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA). We use items from both instruments to compile a short test. Based on a sample of 290 second-year non-computer science undergraduate students, we provide evidence on the quality of our test. Besides classical test theory, we apply item response theory, namely Rasch modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis. Our test shows favorable properties, e.g., Cronbach's alpha {$>$} .75, and may be suitable for the efficient assessment of CT across higher education programs.},

Generative language models might be able to support humans in formulating reviews with textual suggestions. Previous systems use two designs for providing text suggestions, but do not empirically evaluate them: inline and list of suggestions. To investigate the effects of embedding NLP text generation models in the two designs, we collected user requirements to implement Hamta as an example of assistants providing reviewers with text suggestions. Our experiment on comparing the two designs on 31 participants indicates that people using the inline interface provided longer reviews on average, while participants using the list of suggestions experienced more ease of use in using our tool. The results shed light on important design findings for embedding text generation models in user-centered assistants.},

This is in particular problematic, since feedback belongs to the most influential factors for the student learning success. In order to overcome the challenges of providing feedback in large-scale classes, we suggest using an IT-based solution we label digital formative learning assessment tool (DFLAT). In this research-in-progress paper, we will show the development of this tool by using the method of action design research (ADR). More precisely, we will concentrate on the first part from the requirements gathering to the alpha-version. In order to collect the requirements, we conducted expert interviews with lecturers and students and also derived requirements from scientific literature. Based on the requirements, we will define the key design elements of the first version of DFLAT. The next steps in our research are then the intervention and evaluation of our alpha-version in a large-scale lecture. With our completed research, we aim to contribute to literature by developing a theory of design and action for providing individualized feedback for students in large-scale classes.},

  abstract = {Peer feedback in online education becomes increasingly important to meet the demand for feedback in large scale classes, such as e.g. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). However, students are often not experts in how to write helpful feedback to their fellow students. In this paper, we introduce a corpus compiled from university students' peer feedback to be able to detect suggestions on how to improve the students' work and therefore being able to capture peer feedback helpfulness. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is the first student peer feedback corpus in German which additionally was labelled with a new annotation scheme. The corpus consists of more than 600 written feedback (about 7,500 sentences). The utilisation of the corpus is broadly ranged from Dependency Parsing to Sentiment Analysis to Suggestion Mining, etc. We applied the latter to empirically validate the utility of the new corpus. Suggestion Mining is the extraction of sentences that contain suggestions from unstructured text. In this paper, we present a new annotation scheme to label sentences for Suggestion Mining. Two independent annotators labelled the corpus and achieved an inter-annotator agreement of 0.71. With the help of an expert arbitrator a gold standard was created. An automatic classification using BERT achieved an accuracy of 75.3\%.}

  abstract = {With the growth of online learning through MOOCs and other educational applications, it has become increasingly difficult for course providers to offer personalized feedback to students. Therefore asking students to provide feedback to each other has become one way to support learning. This peer-to-peer feedback has become increasingly important whether in MOOCs to provide feedback to thousands of students or in large-scale classes at universities. One of the challenges when allowing peer-to-peer feedback is that the feedback should be perceived as helpful, and an import factor determining helpfulness is how specific the feedback is. However, in classes including thousands of students, instructors do not have the resources to check the specificity of every piece of feedback between students. Therefore, we present an automatic classification model to measure sentence specificity in written feedback. The model was trained and tested on student feedback texts written in German where sentences have been labelled as general or specific. We find that we can automatically classify the sentences with an accuracy of 76.7\% using a conventional feature-based approach, whereas transfer learning with BERT for German gives a classification accuracy of 81.1\%. However, the feature-based approach comes with lower computational costs and preserves human interpretability of the coefficients. In addition we show that specificity of sentences in feedback texts has a weak positive correlation with perceptions of helpfulness. This indicates that specificity is one of the ingredients of good feedback, and invites further investigation.}

  abstract = {In today's digital transformation era, process mining has emerged as a crucial technology, playing an integral part in the digital strategies of many organizations. Despite its significance, implementing process mining to leverage data-driven decision-making and boosting process efficiency presents notable challenges for such companies. This case study delves into the journey of the fictitious Swiss luxury retailer Elysian as they utilize process mining to derive data-driven insights on process inefficiencies and bottlenecks to increase their customer excellence for online retail procurement. The case highlights the capabilities of process mining for organizations. It is among the first to offer students hands-on guidance on process discovery, conformance, and enhancement using real-world data. Students take the role of Lisa Dister, Head of procurement in the business unit home care, who urgently requires improving process transparency after an unsatisfying internal audit result. This immersive experience helps students understand the application of process mining in high-volume data scenarios and equips them with skills in data literacy. Moreover, students are challenged to suggest recommendations for long-term process optimization and reflect on the effectiveness of process mining for tackling procurement issues.},

Technology-mediated learning platforms have become instrumental in addressing these efforts, as they can analyze platform data to provide personalized learning journeys. Such personalization is expected to increase employees' empowerment, job satisfaction, and learning outcomes. However, the challenge lies in efficiently deploying these opportunities using novel technologies, prompting questions about the design and analysis of generating personalized learning paths in organizational learning. We, therefore, analyze and classify recent research on personalized learning paths into four major concepts (learning context, data, interface, and adaptation) with ten dimensions and 34 characteristics. Six expert interviews validate the taxonomy's use and outline three exemplary use cases, undermining its feasibility. Information Systems researchers can use our taxonomy to develop theoretical models to study the effectiveness of personalized learning paths in intra-organizational re-\&upskilling.},

  abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly utilized to provide adaptivity in educational applications. However, recent research has highlighted a variety of biases in pre-trained language models. While existing studies investigate bias in different domains, they are limited in addressing fine-grained analysis on educational and multilingual corpora. In this work, we analyze bias across text and through multiple architectures on a corpus of 9,165 German peer-reviews collected from university students over five years. Notably, our corpus includes labels such as helpfulness, quality, and critical aspect ratings from the peer-review recipient as well as demographic attributes. We conduct a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) analysis on (1) our collected corpus in connection with the clustered labels, (2) the most common pre-trained German language models (T5, BERT, and GPT-2) and GloVe embeddings, and (3) the language models after fine-tuning on our collected data-set. In contrast to our initial expectations, we found that our collected corpus does not reveal many biases in the co-occurrence analysis or in the GloVe embeddings. However, the pre-trained German language models find substantial conceptual, racial, and gender bias and have significant changes in bias across conceptual and racial axes during fine-tuning on the peer-review data. With our research, we aim to contribute to the fourth UN sustainability goal (quality education) with a novel dataset, an understanding of biases in natural language education data, and the potential harms of not counteracting biases in language models for educational tasks.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in educational tasks such as providing writing suggestions to students. Despite their potential, LLMs are known to harbor inherent biases which may negatively impact learners. Previous studies have investigated bias in models and data representations separately, neglecting the potential impact of LLM bias on human writing. In this paper, we investigate how bias transfers through an AI writing support pipeline. We conduct a large-scale user study with 231 students writing business case peer reviews in German. Students are divided into five groups with different levels of writing support: one classroom group with feature-based suggestions and four groups recruited from Prolific -- a control group with no assistance, two groups with suggestions from fine-tuned GPT-2 and GPT-3 models, and one group with suggestions from pre-trained GPT-3.5. Using GenBit gender bias analysis, Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT), and Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) we evaluate the gender bias at various stages of the pipeline: in model embeddings, in suggestions generated by the models, and in reviews written by students. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in gender bias between the resulting peer reviews of groups with and without LLM suggestions. Our research is therefore optimistic about the use of AI writing support in the classroom, showcasing a context where bias in LLMs does not transfer to students' responses.
