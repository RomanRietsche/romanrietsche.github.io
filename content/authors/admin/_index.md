I hold a professorship in Digital Technology Management at Bern University of Applied Sciences, specializing at the nexus of educational technology, psychology, and human-computer interaction.

My research follows three connected work streams: (1) developing effective information systems that embed artificial intelligence and large language models, 
(2) designing and measuring behavior change through digital interventions, and (3) evaluating the impact of digital technologies on organizations in the context of reskilling and upskilling.

One of my key achievement is the LOOM feedback system, which has enhanced the educational experience of over 2,000 students across the United States, Germany, and Switzerland. 

I led the Swiss Circular Economy of Skills and Competences (SCESC) project (2022-2025), funded by a 6 million Swiss franc grant from Innosuisse.
This project united a multidisciplinary team with researchers from EHB, EPFL, HSG-IWP, HSG-IWI, UZH and ZHAW and the implementation partner X28.

Collaborations with industry, particularly in digital re-skilling and up-skilling, include partnerships with Siemens AG, Volkswagen AG, and Stiftung Brändi.
