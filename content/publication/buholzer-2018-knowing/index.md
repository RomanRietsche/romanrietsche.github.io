abstract: "MOOCs attract learners from various cultural backgrounds with differing\
  \ educational beliefs and learning preferences. Research has long acknowledged that\
  \ culture has an impact on the adoption and use of information technology. Cultural\
  \ differences can cause conflicts, especially when learners provide each other with\
  \ feedback during the peer assessment process. With this paper, we use a design science\
  \ approach to create a cultural sensitive peer assessment process in MOOCs. Based\
  \ on Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimension theory we derive design elements and evaluate\
  \ them in a qualitative and comparative study with Swiss and Chinese students. Our\
  \ results show that different cultures prefer different designs. Consequently, our\
  \ key contribution is the practical elaboration of design elements, which can be\
  \ integrated in MOOCs to provide a better learning experience. Further, we contribute\
  \ to cross-cultural theory by using an existing framework and adapting it to a new\
  \ and relevant phenomenon: MOOCs."
