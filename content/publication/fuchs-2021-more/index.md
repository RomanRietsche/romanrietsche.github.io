abstract: 'More and more employees request feedback from their organizations to develop
  and learn. This is reflected by a growing number of digital feedback apps which facilitate
  high-frequency feedback exchange. However, the effect of feedback has hardly been
  studied on an organizational level due to complexity. Therefore, we strive to analyze
  organizational feedback exchange with an agent-based simulation model. Concretely,
  we study the effect of feedback length and feedback frequency on the organizational
  return on investment (ROI) of feedback exchange. Our study shows that feedback length
  stays in an inverted U-shape relationship with ROI. Contrarily, feedback frequency
  is negatively correlated with ROI. When analyzed jointly, two sweet spots arise: one
  for medium-length, frequent feedback, and the other, for longer infrequent feedback.'
