abstract: "Feedback is one of the most influential factor when it comes to learning\
  \ success of students. Especially large-scale classes at universities often lack\
  \ feedback caused by the scarcity of resources. Even though a lack of feedback is\
  \ problematic across all domains, it is especially crucial when aiming to educate\
  \ future managers, who are supposed to lead team members by providing effective feedback.\
  \ In this study, we use problem-based-learning and a constructivist learning environment\
  \ using IT-based peer assessment (ITPA) in a large-scale class to support future\
  \ managers with feedback during the teaching-learning process. By implementing ITPA,\
  \ we ensure on the one hand that our students regularly receive feedback, and one\
  \ the other hand, we additionally support our students in training their ability to\
  \ provide constructive feedback. While the results of our research show that the conspicuous\
  \ value of ITPA is the increase of the students learning success and the hidden value\
  \ is that at the same time the students train their ability to provide feedback. Specifically,\
  \ our results show that participating in ITPA could lead to an increase in knowledge\
  \ on the content of the class of about 28% on average. Furthermore, the students'\
  \ ability to provide feedback, measured twice, self-reported and as quality of the\
  \ feedback received, increased significantly during the semester."
