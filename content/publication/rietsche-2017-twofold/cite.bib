 abstract = {Feedback is one of the most influential factor when it comes to learning success of students. Especially large-scale classes at universities often lack feedback caused by the scarcity of resources. Even though a lack of feedback is problematic across all domains, especially when educating future IS executives, who are supposed to lead team members by providing effective feedback. In this study, we use IT-based peer assessment (ITPA) in a large-scale class to support learners with feedback during the teaching-learning process. The first results show that students increase their learning success and at the same time, train their ability to provide feedback. Specifically, our results suggest that participating in ITPA could lead to an increase in knowledge on the content of the class of about 28\% on average. Furthermore, the students' ability to provide feedback measured twice, self-reported and as quality of the feedback received -- increased significantly during the class.},
