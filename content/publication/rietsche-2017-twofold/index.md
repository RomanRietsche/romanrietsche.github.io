abstract: "Feedback is one of the most influential factor when it comes to learning\
  \ success of students. Especially large-scale classes at universities often lack\
  \ feedback caused by the scarcity of resources. Even though a lack of feedback is\
  \ problematic across all domains, especially when educating future IS executives,\
  \ who are supposed to lead team members by providing effective feedback. In this\
  \ study, we use IT-based peer assessment (ITPA) in a large-scale class to support\
  \ learners with feedback during the teaching-learning process. The first results\
  \ show that students increase their learning success and at the same time, train\
  \ their ability to provide feedback. Specifically, our results suggest that participating\
  \ in ITPA could lead to an increase in knowledge on the content of the class of\
  \ about 28% on average. Furthermore, the students\u2019 ability to provide feedback measured\
  \ twice, self-reported and as quality of the feedback received \u2013 increased significantly\
  \ during the class."
