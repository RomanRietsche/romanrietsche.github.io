abstract: In today's digital transformation era, process mining has emerged as a crucial
  technology, playing an integral part in the digital strategies of many organizations.
  Despite its significance, implementing process mining to leverage data-driven decision-making
  and boosting process efficiency presents notable challenges for such companies.
  This case study delves into the journey of the fictitious Swiss luxury retailer
  Elysian as they utilize process mining to derive data-driven insights on process
  inefficiencies and bottlenecks to increase their customer excellence for online
  retail procurement. The case highlights the capabilities of process mining for organizations.
  It is among the first to offer students hands-on guidance on process discovery,
  conformance, and enhancement using real-world data. Students take the role of Lisa
  Dister, Head of procurement in the business unit home care, who urgently requires
  improving process transparency after an unsatisfying internal audit result. This
  immersive experience helps students understand the application of process mining
  in high-volume data scenarios and equips them with skills in data literacy. Moreover,
  students are challenged to suggest recommendations for long-term process optimization
  and reflect on the effectiveness of process mining for tackling procurement issues.
