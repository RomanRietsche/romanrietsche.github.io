abstract: "Over the last years, the number of students has constantly risen while\
  \ the number of lecturers remained steady. To the consequence are large-scale classes\
  \ with often hundreds of students. Large-scale classes have didactical challenges\
  \ such as providing effective feedback for the students' learning success. This is\
  \ in particular problematic, since feedback belongs to the most influential factors\
  \ for the student learning success. In order to overcome the challenges of providing\
  \ feedback in large-scale classes, we suggest using an IT-based solution we label\
  \ digital formative learning assessment tool (DFLAT). In this research-in-progress\
  \ paper, we will show the development of this tool by using the method of action\
  \ design research (ADR). More precisely, we will concentrate on the first part from\
  \ the requirements gathering to the alpha-version. In order to collect the requirements,\
  \ we conducted expert interviews with lecturers and students and also derived requirements\
  \ from scientific literature. Based on the requirements, we will define the key design\
  \ elements of the first version of DFLAT. The next steps in our research are then\
  \ the intervention and evaluation of our alpha-version in a large-scale lecture.\
  \ With our completed research, we aim to contribute to literature by developing a\
  \ theory of design and action for providing individualized feedback for students\
  \ in large-scale classes."
