# Information Sharing in the Metaverse

## Bystander Effects and the Role of Immersion

As metaverse platforms gain traction for education, commerce, and social interaction, a critical question emerges: how do users decide what personal information to share in virtual environments, and how does the presence of other avatars affect that behavior? This research project investigates how the presence of bystanders (third-party avatars) in the metaverse affects users' willingness to disclose personal information, and how the level of technological immersion moderates this effect.

Drawing on Social Penetration Theory, which conceptualizes self-disclosure as layered, from factual to cognitive to emotional information, we designed two controlled lab experiments. Participants engaged in information exchange tasks under varying conditions: different levels of immersion (laptop-based 2D access versus VR headset-based 3D access) and different levels of bystander certainty (absent, uncertain presence, or certainly present). The experiments used pre-test and post-test designs with approximately 30 participants per condition.

## Key Findings

The results revealed a striking asymmetry between immersion levels. In the laptop condition (low immersion), bystanders significantly reduced self-disclosure across all conditions, with emotional self-disclosure showing the steepest decline, consistent with the "onion model" of Social Penetration Theory. However, in the VR condition (high immersion), bystander presence had no significant effect. Participants' willingness to share factual, cognitive, or emotional information remained consistent regardless of whether bystander avatars were visibly present. A second study in a commercial (insurance) context confirmed these findings, supporting their generalizability. We propose that immersive VR environments may induce a form of attentional narrowing, where the headset creates a psychological barrier from the external environment that makes users less sensitive to the social context around them.

## Implications

These findings carry important implications for the design of metaverse platforms. For privacy-sensitive applications such as healthcare consultations, counseling, or financial services conducted in virtual spaces, the choice of immersion level materially affects how much users are willing to disclose. Platform designers should consider that VR environments may inadvertently encourage over-sharing by reducing users' awareness of social context, while less immersive interfaces may suppress disclosure in ways that limit the effectiveness of collaborative or therapeutic interactions.
