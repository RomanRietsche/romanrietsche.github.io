# Brandi Digital Skills

## Developing Digital Competencies in the Social Sector

With the World Economic Forum projecting that 44% of professional qualifications will be outdated by 2027, organizations across all sectors face the urgent need to identify skill gaps and design effective re- and upskilling strategies. Stiftung Brandi, a Swiss social and professional foundation based in Kriens, partnered with the Bern University of Applied Sciences and the University of St. Gallen to systematically advance the digital competencies of its workforce. The project aimed to define employee roles, derive matching digital skill profiles for each role, create a Role-Skill-Matrix, and design role-based continuing education measures to close identified skill gaps.

## Approach and Methodology

The project was structured into three sub-projects spanning 2023 to 2024. The first phase developed workshop concepts for deriving future skill requirements by analyzing technology trends for each business area and assessing skill needs with experienced employees, building on previously conducted DigiComp self-assessments. The second phase focused on creating a scientifically grounded Skill Matrix based on the European Digital Competence Framework (DigiComp), using a 9-level proficiency scale from Beginner (B1-B3) through Intermediate (I1-I3) to Expert (E1-E3). Self-assessment and peer-assessment methods were used to map current competency levels against target profiles. The third phase identified internal and external training opportunities for each competency area, conducted a market analysis of education providers, and developed personalized continuing education recommendations.

## Outcomes

The project delivered a complete workshop methodology and training materials, a Role-Skill-Matrix mapping digital competencies to organizational roles, and a structured continuing education catalog matching training offerings to individual skill profiles. The gap analysis revealed concrete discrepancies between current and target skill levels, enabling Stiftung Brandi to prioritize its training investments. The methodology was designed to be transferable, providing a blueprint that other organizations in the social sector can adapt.

## Team and Collaboration

The project was led by Prof. Dr. Roman Rietsche (BFH, Institute for Digital Technology Management) in collaboration with Eva Ritz and Leonie Freise from the University of St. Gallen. Stiftung Brandi, led by Prof. Dr. Andreas Liedtke, provided organizational access and served as the practice partner. The project followed an agile approach, combining academic rigor with practical applicability under confidentiality agreements.
